## PARA System

PARA, an acronym for Projects, Areas of Responsibility, Resources, and Archives, offers a personal organization system that categorizes your notes based on their actionability. Each category serves a specific purpose in sorting and managing your notes effectively.

"Projects" encompass ongoing endeavors that require frequent updates and changes to their associated notes. For instance, learning to use this vault can be considered an ongoing project. Once you complete a project, its folder can be moved to the "Archives" category, which houses items that are no longer actively worked on or modified. Notes in the "Archives" section typically remain untouched.

"Areas of Responsibility" and "Resources" lie between "Projects" and "Archives" in terms of actionability. These categories represent spaces where notes are periodically or occasionally revised. When distinguishing between the two, a helpful guideline is to consider "Resources" as a repository for shareable content such as recipes or development shortcuts. On the other hand, "Areas of Responsibility" should house personal content, including daily notes and information about acquaintances.

Once you become familiar with the PARA system, feel free to experiment and customize it according to your preferences. As your vault expands, it's important to establish a navigation system that provides convenience and scalability for managing a growing and diverse database.

By embracing PARA and finding a polychotomization (subdivision) that suits your needs, you'll have a robust and adaptable organizational framework at your disposal. This system will empower you to efficiently navigate and manage your expanding vault of notes.

## Finding The Note You Want

One of the key practices to optimize note organization and retrieval is through the use of tags and metadata. By embracing metadata, you can create your own dictionary lookup system, making it easier to find specific notes within your vault. While Obsidian is already a powerful tool, its true potential lies within a customized vault of your own design.

By making your notes queryable, you can unlock access to your own knowledge in a manner that your own brain cannot mimic. Obsidian provides a range of fantastic community plugins, and perhaps the most foundational of them is called "Dataview." While I will delve into the details of each plugin within this vault, it's important to note that the overall structure is designed to complement and enable the use of Dataview.

The goal is to eliminate the need for manual searching through your notes, trying to locate a specific piece of knowledge that was recorded long ago. Instead of relying on cumbersome searching methods like using _grep_, it is far more effective to assign appropriate metadata to your notes as you write them. This thoughtful approach will pay off when your future self can easily retrieve valuable information. However, before diving into querying notes, I will discuss some basic features of markdown notes and Obsidian in the section titled [[2_Base_Features]]. If you are already familiar with these features, feel free to skip ahead to the [[3_Dataview_and_Tasks]] section for more advanced techniques.
