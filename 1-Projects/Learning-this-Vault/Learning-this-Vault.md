# Learning This Vault
## Introduction
Greetings, and welcome to Obsidian! I'm Alex Yaroslavskiy, and as of now, I have been using Obsidian for approximately nine months. Throughout my journey, I've encountered numerous remarkable and specialized use cases for this software. In fact, I've introduced it to friends and colleagues with the hope that they, too, would discover additional features and share their insights with me. While Obsidian is already an exceptional tool for maintaining a personal wiki, it can offer an even more enriching experience by leveraging the best of its features.

With that in mind, I have curated a comprehensive vault that combines the most essential and valuable features, along with accompanying instructions. This vault is designed to make it easier for you to embrace the power of Obsidian and explore its potential. Within the following pages, you will find a concise guide on utilizing the core features of Obsidian, as well as insights into the custom features provided within this vault.

I sincerely hope that this resource enhances your personal knowledge management journey, and I encourage you to share it with your friends, spreading the word about Obsidian's remarkable capabilities.

## Acknowledgements
Acknowledging every single source of inspiration and the individuals from whom I've borrowed scripts and queries would be an immense challenge, if not impossible. However, I want to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to the Obsidian Reddit community. Your collective insights and contributions have been invaluable in fueling my enthusiasm for Obsidian and discovering new ways to maximize its potential.

Additionally, I am grateful to my coworkers who have shared my passion for Obsidian and have offered their own innovative ideas. Their collaboration and support have played a significant role in shaping the features and innovations found within this vault.

To everyone who has contributed to my journey with Obsidian, whether directly or indirectly, I extend my heartfelt gratitude. It is through our shared enthusiasm and collective efforts that we continue to push the boundaries of personal knowledge management.
