### Caeser Salad

 >Notes: This works really will with a butterflied chicken breast, either grilled or fried. Let the chicken cool before mixing with the dressing, or it will cook the egg inside the dressing. 
 >Do not add all the croutons right away, or they will get soggy. Recommend reserving some croutons to add to leftovers.

### Recipe

#### Intro:
American classic that is amazing when the dressing is homemade. Can be paired with protein of choice. Subbing with arugula can give it a strong kick.

---
#### Directions
Start with the dressing. Combine egg yolks, vinegar, and mustard in a bowl and whisk until consistent. Slowly drizzle in olive oil while whisking, and continue until the emulsification has the consistency of heavy cream, or mayonnaise. This is a basic mayonnaise, and is the base of the dressing.

Finely chop or mash the garlic with the anchovies into a paste, and add it into the dressing along with the parmesan. Continue whisking until consistent, then season with salt and pepper. Splash about a tbsp of lemon juice from the lemon, and add a tbsp of water. Whisk once more until mixture is homogeneous. 

Broadly cut the romaine lettuce, and mix with 1/4 of the croutons. Mix with half of the dressing. Reserve remaining half to mix with protein of choice. Top with protein and 1/4 of the croutons.
