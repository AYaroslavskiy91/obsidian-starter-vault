### Recipe
---
#### Intro:
Great and easy way to process boned chicken. Works for quarters, thighs, and legs. 

---
#### Directions
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Heat a stainless steel pan while seasoning the chicken. Work the seasoning into the chicken. Once the pan is hot, add olive oil and sear the chicken, skin side down. You can skip this step if the chicken is skinless. About 1-2 minutes per side, depending on pan heat.

Bake in the oven with skin side up until cooked. This can vary in time depending on the size of the chicken, anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes. Check for done-ness by poking with a knife. If the juices run clear, it is ready. Turn on your broilers, and sear the skin for another few minutes, until crispy. Let cool for a few minutes and serve.
