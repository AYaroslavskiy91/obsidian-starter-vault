### Recipe
---
#### Intro:
There are many ways to do this, but this encompasses one way to process these vegetables.

---
#### Directions
Chop up the cabbage coarsely, and massage a bunch of salt in. Let sit for a couple of hours while the salt drains the water out. Do the same with the turnips, slicing them into matchsticks. 

In the meantime, make the paste. Shred the scallions, ginger, and garlic, then add the sauces. Continue shredding into a paste using an blender, or mortal and pestle, or whichever implement of preference. Add the sweetener and the starch, and continue blending. 

Taste the cabbage and turnip when they are ready for salt levels. They should be just a little salty. If they are too salty, drain, and wash to reduce salt content. 

Once ready to jar, mix all the parts together and massage the paste into the veggies. Put in mason jar and make sure water level is just above veggies. Add a weight, and seal up with a water lock. 

This can be eaten immediately, or allowed to ferment for several days to a week before refrigerating. Taste periodically until it tastes good to you.
