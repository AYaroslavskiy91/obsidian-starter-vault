# Other Community Plugins
<< [[Templater and Quickadd]] | [[Conclusion]] >>
## Linter
Obsidian has a wonderful linter for standardizing the appearance and structure of the notes within. It will be set to lint on save (cmd/ctrl+s). Stop worrying about formatting, or any other job, that a computer can do for you! Explore the Linter settings (they are vast) to set it up the way you like it, though the provided settings are personally curated.

## Auto Link Title
This is a wonderfully simple plugin. Provide a hyperlink cleanly in your notes without the pains of manually formatting its appearance.

Consider the following two pasted URLs:
[GitHub: Let’s build from here · GitHub](https://github.com/)
https://github.com/

Which one do you prefer?

## Better Word Count
Whether you need to make sure your object name meets a character limit, or whether you need to limit your Sending spell to 25 words, Better Word Count has your back. Highlight the text and see the associated character and word count. As an added bonus, Better Word Count will track some interesting statistics for your vault and save them into a JSON.

## Buttons
This is completely motived by phone-based convenience. Using Obsidian on your phone can be painful if you do not optimize the experience. One choice is to change the core settings to limit the list of commands on the command palette, but I find that creating buttons is an easier and more streamlined solution.

## Folder Note
Do you ever click on a folder and immediately want a summary of the notes therein? Folder Note is the fix. Provide a note in each folder with the same name as the folder and watch it get absorbed. Here, you can place any number of queries that summarize the pages therein, which eases navigation and removes the mental calculus required to determine what note you need based upon title alone.

## Tasks
The simplest feature of Tasks is the ease with which it allows you to instantiate tasks with creation date and due dates, as well as allowing you to complete tasks with completion dates. It can further accomplish even more, as it contains features for creating reoccurring tasks and offers its own querying language, expanding upon the task querying possibilities offered by Dataview. See [Introduction - Tasks User Guide - Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction) for the full documentation.

## Editor Syntax Highlight
This is just nice to look at. Try turning it off and see how much time passes before you miss it.
