# Conclusion
<< [[Other Community Plugins]]

## Activating the Vault
There isn't really much that you need to do before using this vault. Make sure you explore the templates a little and understand the use case of each feature, as well as remove the features you do not find necessary. Having daily notes is fairly powerful, so I recommend you start there.

There are multiple files that point to a 'workplace_filler' tag: [[Template - Meeting]], [[Banana Steelbutton|My Work Friend]], [[2023-06-05 My first meeting]], and [[pickPersonWork.js]]. Replace those with your specific workplace tag so that you can separate your future meetings (at other jobs) from current ones. Once that is done, the vault is ready to use!

## Customization and Communication
Obsidian is as powerful as you make it. Add and remove features, explore the community plugins, and create niche uses that fit your lifestyle. Most importantly, reach out to me with your amazing ideas so I can add them into my own workflow. Find me at ayaroslavskiy91@gmail.com with your ideas or questions. I sincerely hope you enjoy this vault as much as I enjoyed making it. Good luck and happy note-taking!
