# Learning This Vault
## Introduction
Welcome to Obsidian! My name is Alex Yaroslavskiy and at the time of writing, I have been using Obsidian for approximately nine months. During this time, I have come across a multitude of wonderful niche use cases of this software. I have also introduced this software to a collection of friends and colleagues in the --now fulfilled-- hopes that they discover yet more features that can be communicated back to me. While Obsidian is a wonderful way to maintain a personal wiki, it can provide an enhanced experience by combining the best of these features. Thus, in the effort of preaching the Obsidian gospel, I have collected the most fundamental and useful of these features into one ready-to-use vault, along with some instruction. Find within the pages below a brief how-to for using base Obsidian features as well as some of the custom features provided in this vault. I hope you benefit from this development in personal knowledge management and share it with your friends.

## Acknowledgements
It would be nearly impossible to list all the sources from which I draw inspiration, or from which I lift scripts and queries. Nonetheless, I wish to express my gratitude to the Obsidian Reddit community and to those coworkers of mine who have shared my enthusiasm and who have provided their innovations.
