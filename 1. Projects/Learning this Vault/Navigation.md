## PARA System

PARA (Projects, Areas of Responsibility, Resources, Archives) is a personal organization system that sorts your notes by actionability. "Projects" should contain any ongoing projects that see frequent changes in their notes. To begin, learning to use this vault is an ongoing project. Once completed, that folder can be moved to "Archives", the space of least actionable items. Notes in "Archives" are almost never altered.

In between these two categories lie "Areas of Responsibility" and "Resources". These represent spaces in which notes are periodically or occasionally changed. A good rule of thumb for separating your notes between the two is to consider the space of "Resources" to be shareable content (such as, for instance, recipes or development shortcuts), while placing any personal content into "Areas of Responsibility". This can --and, in this vault, does-- include daily notes and personal acquaintances.

Once you become comfortable with the system, experiment with a polychotomization of your own that you find comfortable. An expanding vault needs a system of navigational convenience that scales well with a growing and diverse database.

## Finding The Note You Want

Tag your notes! Embrace metadata! Notes are easier to find if create your own dictionary lookup system. While Obsidian is a perfectly usable piece of software without this adornment, its true power is locked inside a _vault_ of your own design. By making your notes queryable, you can provide yourself access to your own knowledge in a way that human brains can mimic in only a few movies. There are many wonderful community plugins, and perhaps the most fundamental of them is _Dataview_. I will go into some detail about every plugin herein, but keep in mind that the general structure of this vault is designed to complement and enable Dataview.

The point is to avoid manually searching through your notes for that tidbit of knowledge long past recorded. Do not grep through your vault. Assign the proper metadata to your notes as you write them, and your future self will thank you. Before I talk about querying notes, however, I will discuss some basic features of markdown notes and Obsidian in [[Base Features]]. If you feel comfortable with that already, feel free to skip ahead to [[Dataview]].
